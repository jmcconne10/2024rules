> excitement of a championship-style sporting event. Teams are
> encouraged to display *Gracious Professionalism*®, help other teams,
> and cooperate while competing. This is known as *Coopertition*®.
>
> In 2024, *FIRST* Robotics Competition is projected to reach
> approximately 90,000 high-school students representing approximately
> 3,600 teams. Teams come from nearly every state in the United States,
> as well as many other countries.
>
> *FIRST* Robotics Competition teams will participate in 61 Regional
> Competitions, 97 District Competitions, and 11 District Championships.
> In addition, approximately 600 teams will qualify to attend the
> *FIRST* Championship in April 2024.
>
> This year's game, and this manual, were presented at the 2024 *FIRST*
> Robotics Competition Kickoff on Saturday, January 6, 2024.
>
> At the Kickoff, all teams:
>
> − saw the 2024 game, CRESCENDOSM presented by Haas, for the first
> time, − learned about the 2024 game rules and regulations, and\
> − received a set of game specific materials.

> **1.4*Gracious Professionalism*®, a *FIRST* Credo**
>
> *Gracious Professionalism*® is part of the ethos of *FIRST*. It's a
> way of doing things that encourages high quality work, emphasizes the
> value of others, and respects individuals and the community.
>
> *Gracious Professionalism* is not clearly defined for a reason. It can
> and should mean different things to everyone.
>
> Some possible meanings of *Gracious Professionalism* include:
>
> − gracious attitudes and behaviors are win-win,\
> − gracious folks respect others and let that respect show in their
> actions,\
> − professionals possess special knowledge and are trusted by society
> to use that knowledge responsibly, and\
> − gracious professionals make a valued contribution in a manner
> pleasing to others and to themselves.
>
> In the context of *FIRST*, this means that all teams and participants
> should:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| > −\                              | > learn to be strong competitors, |
| > −                               | > but also treat one another with |
|                                   | > respect and kindness in the     |
|                                   | > process and avoid leaving       |
|                                   | > anyone feeling as if they are   |
|                                   | > excluded or unappreciated.      |
+===================================+===================================+
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

> Knowledge, pride, and empathy should be comfortably and genuinely
> blended.
>
> In the end, *Gracious Professionalism* is part of pursuing a
> meaningful life. When professionals use knowledge in a gracious manner
> and individuals act with integrity and sensitivity, everyone wins and

> *"The FIRST spirit encourages doing high-quality, well-informed work
> in a manner that leaves everyone feeling valued. Gracious
> Professionalism seems to be a good descriptor for part of the ethos of
> FIRST. It is part of what makes FIRST different and wonderful."*\
> *- Dr. Woodie Flowers, (1943 -- 2019)* *Distinguished Advisor to
> FIRST*
>
> It is a good idea to spend time going over this concept with your team
> and reinforcing it regularly. We recommend providing your team with
> real-life examples of *Gracious Professionalism* in practice, such as
> when a team loans valuable materials or expertise to another team that
> they will later face as an opponent in competition. Routinely
> highlight opportunities to display *Gracious Professionalism* at
> events and encourage team members to suggest ways in which they can
> demonstrate this quality themselves and through outreach activities.
>
> **1.5*Coopertition*®**
>
> At *FIRST*, *Coopertition*® is displaying unqualified kindness and
> respect in the face of fierce competition. *Coopertition* is founded
> on the concept and philosophy that teams can and should help and
> cooperate with one another even as they compete. *Coopertition*
> involves learning from teammates and mentors. *Coopertition* means
> competing always but assisting and enabling others when you can.
>
> ***Message from Woodie Flowers Award Recipients***
>
> *The Woodie Flowers Award is the most prestigious mentoring award in
> FIRST. The award recipients created an important message for all FIRST
> Robotics Competition teams to consider as we tackle each season.*
>
> *Performing at your best is important. Winning is important. This is a
> competition.*
>
> *However, winning with Gracious Professionalism and being proud of
> what you have accomplished and how you have accomplished it is more
> important. FIRST could create rules and penalties to cover almost any
> scenario or situation, but we prefer an understandable game with
> simpler rules that allow us to think and be creative in our designs.*
>
> *We want to know that our partners and opponents are playing at their
> best in every MATCH. We want to know they are playing with integrity
> and not using strategies based on questionable behaviors.*
>
> *As you create your ROBOTS and award presentations, prepare for
> competition and MATCH play, create and implement game strategies, and
> live your daily lives, remember what Woodie said time and time again,
> and let's 'Make your Grandmother proud.'*

>
> During the first 15 seconds of the match, robots are autonomous.
> Without guidance from their drivers, robots leave their starting zone,
> score notes in their speaker or amp, and collect and score additional
> notes.
>
> During the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds, drivers control their
> robots. Robots collect notes from human players at their source and
> score them in their amp and speaker. Each time an alliance gets 2
> notes in their amp, the human player can amplify their speaker for 10
> seconds. Notes scored in an amplified speaker are worth more points
> than those scored in an unamplified speaker.
>
> A human player may choose to repurpose a note scored in their amp in
> cooperation with their opponent. If each alliance repurposes a note by
> hitting their *Coopertition* button in the first 45 seconds of teleop,
> all teams in the match receive a *Coopertition* point (which
> influences their rank in the tournament), and the number of notes
> needed for the melody bonus is reduced.
>
> As time runs out, robots race to get onstage and deliver notes to
> their traps. Harmonizing robots, i.e. robots sharing a chain, earn an
> added bonus. Robots earn even more points if a human player spotlights

> **6.1MATCH Overview**
>
> MATCHES run on 7--10-minute cycles, which consist of pre-MATCH setup,
> the 2-minute and 30-second MATCH, and the post-MATCH reset.
>
> During the MATCH, ROBOTS score NOTES in their SPEAKER or AMP. HUMAN
> PLAYERS use NOTES scored through the AMP to AMPLIFY the points
> associated with NOTES scored in their SPEAKER for 10 seconds at a time
> or engage in *Coopertition* with their opponents.
>
> ROBOTS conclude the MATCH PARKING in their STAGE ZONE, getting ONSTAGE
> via a chain, and/or scoring a NOTE in a TRAP.
>
> Additional points are awarded if an ALLIANCE HARMONIZES (i.e. more
> than 1 ROBOT is ONSTAGE via the same chain) and if HUMAN PLAYERS
> SPOTLIGHT ROBOTS (i.e. score a HIGH NOTE on a MICROPHONE to increase
> points awarded for those ONSTAGE ROBOTS).

| > team and are responsible for their team's and ROBOT'S performance   |
| > at the event (this means a person may be affiliated with more than  |
| > 1 team). The intent is not to allow teams to "adopt" members of     |
| > other teams for strategic advantage for the loaning team, borrowing |
| > team, and/or their ALLIANCE (e.g. an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN believes 1 of |
| > their DRIVERS has more experience than a DRIVER on their first      |
| > pick, and the teams agree the first pick team will "adopt" that     |

| > bureaucratic burden on teams and event volunteers (e.g. requiring   |
| > that teams submit official rosters that Queuing must check before   |
| > allowing a DRIVE TEAM into the ARENA). Second, to provide space for |
| > exceptional circumstances that give teams the opportunity to        |
| > display *Gracious Professionalism* (e.g. a bus is delayed, a COACH  |

> 3-second delay between AUTO and TELEOP for scoring purposes as
> described in [Section 6.5 Scoring]{.underline}.
>
> The second phase of each MATCH is the remaining 2 minutes and 15

> **6.5.1NOTE Scoring Criteria**
>
> A NOTE is scored in a SPEAKER once it passes through the FIELD-facing
> opening of the SPEAKER and through the sensor array.
>
> A NOTE is scored in the AMP once it passes through the FIELD-facing
> opening of the AMP and through the sensor array.
>
> A NOTE is scored in the TRAP if it enters the TRAP from above (i.e.
> through the cutout above the AprilTag).
>
> **6.5.2ROBOT Scoring Criteria**
>
> To qualify for LEAVE points, a ROBOT'S BUMPERS must completely clear
> its ROBOT STARTING ZONE at any point during AUTO.
>
> To qualify for PARK points, a ROBOT'S BUMPERS must be partially or
> completely contained in the STAGE ZONE at the end of the MATCH (more
> specifically, per criteria described in [item C of Section 6.5
> Scoring]{.underline}) and does not meet the criteria for ONSTAGE.
>
> To qualify for ONSTAGE points, a ROBOT may only be contacting:
>
> A.their truss legs (pink shaded elements in Figure 6-3) via ROBOT
> BUMPERS,\
> B.GAME PIECES,\
> C.chain-facing vertical surfaces of their core or the nearest flap
> (with regards to the chain used by the ONSTAGE ROBOT, green shaded
> elements in Figure 6-3),\
> D.carpet-facing surfaces of their core (blue shaded elements in Figure
> 6-3), and\
> E.a single STAGE chain (on their STAGE) (highlighted in orange in in
> Figure 6-3),\
> F.another ROBOT qualified for ONSTAGE points,\
> G.a partner ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of
> [G424]{.underline}, and\
> H.an opponent ROBOT.

> **6.5.3AMPLIFICATION**
>
> AMPLIFICATION increases the number of MATCH points awarded for NOTES
> scored in a SPEAKER per Table 6-2. To AMPLIFY, an ALLIANCE must have
> at least 2 NOTES through their AMP. Once this criterion is met, the
> HUMAN PLAYER may press the AMP button which AMPLIFIES their SPEAKER
> for 10 seconds or until 4 NOTES are scored in that SPEAKER, whichever
> comes first. Due to NOTE transit time from the SPEAKER opening to the
> sensor array, there is a 3-second extension on the end of the nominal
> AMPLIFICATION time to account for NOTES that entered the SPEAKER
> within 10 seconds of the AMP button being pressed but haven't yet been
> processed. An ALLIANCE must collect another 2 NOTES through their AMP
> after AMPLIFICATION ends before they are able to AMPLIFY their SPEAKER
> again. While NOTES delivered through the AMP after the 2-NOTE
> threshold is reached or during AMPLIFICATION do not contribute to the
> next AMPLIFICATION or *Coopertition* requirement, they do earn MATCH
> points (in other words, and ALLIANCE can only "bank" up to 2 NOTES at
> a time toward AMPLIFICATION or *Cooperition*).
>
> **6.5.4SPOTLIGHTING**
>
> ALLIANCES may SPOTLIGHT ROBOTS by scoring a HIGH NOTE on a MICROPHONE.
> A HIGH NOTE is scored on the MICROPHONE if the NOTE surrounds, i.e.

> **6.6.1YELLOW and RED CARDS**
>
> In addition to rule violations explicitly listed throughout this
> document, YELLOW CARDS and RED CARDS are used in *FIRST* Robotics
> Competition to address team and ROBOT behavior that does not align
> with the mission, values, and culture of *FIRST*.
>
> The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW CARD as a warning, or a RED CARD
> for egregious behavior inappropriate at a *FIRST* Robotics Competition
> event.
>
> A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW
> and/or RED CARD in the air while the Game Announcer describes the
> violation.
>
> YELLOW CARDS are additive, meaning that a second YELLOW CARD is
> automatically converted to a RED CARD. A team is issued a RED CARD for
> any subsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW
> CARD, including earning a second YELLOW CARD during a single MATCH. A
> second YELLOW CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW
> CARD and RED CARD in the air simultaneously after the completion of
> the MATCH. A team that has received either a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD
> carries a YELLOW CARD into subsequent MATCHES, except as noted below.
>
> Once a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, its team number is
> presented with a yellow background on the audience screen at the
> beginning of all subsequent MATCHES, including any replays, as a

> **6.6.3YELLOW and RED CARDS during Playoff MATCHES**
>
> During Playoff MATCHES, YELLOW and RED CARDS are assigned to the
> violating team's entire ALLIANCE instead of to only the violating
> team. If an ALLIANCE receives 2 YELLOW CARDS, the entire ALLIANCE is
> issued a RED CARD which results in DISQUALIFICATION for the associated
> MATCH. If both ALLIANCES receive a RED CARD, the ALLIANCE assessed the
> first RED CARD, chronologically, is DISQUALIFIED and loses the MATCH.

> **6.6.4Violation Details**
>
> There are several styles of violation wording used in this manual.
> Below are some example violations and a clarification of the way the
> violation would be assessed. The examples shown do not represent all
> possible violations, but rather a representative set of combinations.

> **8ROBOT Construction Rules**
>
> The rules listed below explicitly address legal parts and materials
> and how those parts and materials may be used on a CRESCENDO ROBOT. A
> ROBOT is an electromechanical assembly built by the *FIRST* Robotics
> Competition team to play the current season's game and includes all
> the basic systems required to be an active participant in the game
> --power, communications, control, BUMPERS, and movement about the
> FIELD. A BUMPER is a protective assembly designed to attach to the
> exterior of the ROBOT and constructed as specified in [Section 8.4
> BUMPER Rules]{.underline}.
>
> There are many reasons for the structure of the rules, including
> safety, reliability, parity, creation of a reasonable design
> challenge, adherence to professional standards, impact on the
> competition, and compatibility with the The KOP is the collection of
> items listed on the current season's Kickoff Kit Checklists,
> distributed to the team via *FIRST* Choice in the current season, or
> paid for completely (except shipping) with a Product Donation Voucher
> (PDV) from the current season.
>
> Another intent of these rules is to have all energy sources and active
> actuation systems on the ROBOT (e.g. batteries, compressors, motors,
> servos, cylinders, and their controllers) drawn from a well-defined
> set of options. This is to ensure that all teams have access to the
> same actuation resources and that the INSPECTORS are able to
> accurately and efficiently assess the legality of a given part.
>
> ROBOTS are made up of COMPONENTS and MECHANISMS. A COMPONENT is any
> part in its most basic configuration, which cannot be disassembled
> without damaging or destroying the part or altering its fundamental
> function. A MECHANISM is an assembly of COMPONENTS that provide
> specific functionality on the ROBOT. A MECHANISM can be disassembled
> (and then reassembled) into individual COMPONENTS without damage to
> the parts.
>

> Each 2024 *FIRST* Robotics Competition event is played in a tournament
> format. Each tournament consists of 3 types of MATCHES: Practice
> MATCHES (not necessarily played at all District Events), Qualification
> MATCHES, and Playoff MATCHES.
>
> Practice MATCHES provide each team with an opportunity to operate its
> ROBOT on the FIELD prior to the start of the Qualification MATCHES.
>
> Qualification MATCHES allow each team to earn Ranking Points which
> determine their seeding position and may qualify them for
> participation in the Playoff MATCHES.
>
> Playoff MATCHES determine the event Champions.
>
> **10.1MATCH Schedules**
>
> A MATCH schedule is used to coordinate MATCHES at an Event. Figure
> 10-1 details information shown on each schedule. SURROGATE MATCHES are
> described in [Section 10.5.2 MATCH Assignment]{.underline}.

> **10.2MATCH Replays**
>
> Over the course of the tournament, it may be necessary for a MATCH to
> be replayed. Typical causes for replays are MATCHES that end in a tie
> during the Playoffs (due to criteria listed in Table 10-3 or any
> Finals MATCH), MATCHES that are stopped because FIELD STAFF
> anticipated FIELD damage or personal injury, or if there is an ARENA
> FAULT. An ARENA FAULT is an error in ARENA operation that includes,
> but is not limited to:
>
> A.broken FIELD elements due to\
> a.normal, expected game play or\
> b.ROBOT abuse of FIELD elements that affects the outcome of the MATCH
> for their opponents

> MATCHES (varies by event size) **2.**minimize the number of times a
> team is allied with any team\
> **3.**minimize the number of times a team plays opposite any team\
> **4.**minimize the use of SURROGATES (teams randomly assigned by the
> FMS to play an extra Qualification MATCH)\
> **5.**provide even distribution of MATCHES played on blue and red

>
> Once a single ALLIANCE remains in each Upper and Lower bracket, those
> ALLIANCES proceed to the Finals round. The first ALLIANCE to win 2
> MATCHES in the Finals becomes the event's Champions.
>
> If a Finals MATCH ends in a tie score, the tie is not broken using the
> criteria in Table 10-3, the MATCH remains a tie. In the case where an
> ALLIANCE hasn't won 2 MATCHES after 3 MATCHES have been played
> (because of tied MATCHES), the Playoffs proceed with up to 3
> additional Finals MATCHES, called Overtime MATCHES, until an ALLIANCE
> has won 2 Finals MATCHES. In the case where the Overtime MATCH scores
> for both ALLIANCES are equal, the win for that Overtime MATCH is
> awarded based on the criteria listed in Table 10-3.
>
> **10.6.3BACKUP TEAMS**
>
> During the Playoff MATCHES an ALLIANCE may elect to replace one of its
> ROBOTS due to a mechanical or software issue that prevents that ROBOT
> from competing effectively. The team whose ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM
> replaces another ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM on an ALLIANCE during the
> Playoff MATCHES is called the BACKUP TEAM.
>
> In this situation, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN has the option to bring in the
> highest ranked team from the pool of available teams to join its
> ALLIANCE for the following MATCH. The resulting ALLIANCE is then
> composed of 4 teams.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > ALLIANCES submit LINEUPS (as described in [Section 10.6.4           |
| > LINEUPS]{.underline}) for each Playoff MATCH. After the BACKUP      |
| > TEAM's first Playoff MATCH, the ALLIANCE'S LINEUP may consist of    |

> *10.6.3.1BACKUP TEAM Coupons*
>
> Each ALLIANCE is allotted 1 BACKUP TEAM coupon during the Playoff
> MATCHES. If a second ROBOT from the ALLIANCE becomes inoperable, then
> the ALLIANCE must play the following MATCHES with only 2 (or even 1)
> ROBOTS.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > Example: 3 teams, A, B and C, form an ALLIANCE going into the       |
| > Playoff MATCHES. The highest ranked team not on 1 of the 8          |
| > ALLIANCES is Team D.                                                |

| > During 1 of the Playoff MATCHES, Team C's ROBOT suffers damage to   |
| > its mechanical arm. The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN decides to bring in Team D |
| > to replace Team C in the next MATCH. The new ALLIANCE of Teams A,   |
| > B, C, and D are successful in advancing to the Finals and win the   |
| > event. Teams A, B, C, and D are all recognized as members of the    |
| > Winning ALLIANCE and receive awards.                                |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> The Head REFEREE will not accept the BACKUP TEAM coupon unless it

> **11.1.1Qualification Round Performance**
>
> The calculation of Qualification performance points is done using the
> equation (an inverse error function) in Table 11-1. The equation
> utilizes the following variables:
>
> oR -- the qualification rank of the team at the event at the
> conclusion of Qualification MATCHES (as reported by FMS)\
> oN -- the number of *FIRST* Robotics Competition teams participating
> in the Qualification rounds at the event\
> oAlpha (α) -- a static value (1.07) used to standardize the
> distribution of points at events
>
> This formula generates an approximately normal distribution of
> Qualification Round Performance points at an event, based on rank,
> with most teams getting a moderate number of points, and fewer teams
> getting the highest or lowest numbers of points available.
>
> Table 11-3 displays sample Qualification Round Performance points for
> variously ranked teams at a 40-team event. The system will
> automatically generate the appropriate points for each team based on
> their rank and the number of teams at the event.

> **11.1.2ALLIANCE Selection Results**
>
> This attribute measures both individual team qualification round
> seeding performance and recognition by peers.
>
> ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are recognized based on their qualification round
> seeding rank. This rank is a result of the rules of the game, which
> typically incorporate several team performance attributes, and are
> designed to eliminate ties in rank. Non-ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are rewarded
> based on peer recognition. To be invited to join an ALLIANCE, a team's
> peers have decided that the team has attributes that are desirable.
> Giving points for ALLIANCE selection also supports come-from-behind
> teams. A team taking several MATCHES to optimize their performance may
> be recognized as a late bloomer by a top seeded team, even if that
> performance isn't reflected in the rankings because of poor
> performance in early MATCHES. These points also have the potential to
> recognize teams employing a minority strategy with their ROBOT. Teams
> with unique or divergent ROBOT capabilities that complement the
> strengths of other ALLIANCE members may be selected to fill a
> strategic niche.
>
> Note also that ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are given the same number of points
> as the team drafted in the same sequence. For example, the third
> ALLIANCE CAPTAIN gets the same number of points as the third draft.
> Numerical analysis supports the idea that ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are about
> as strong in ROBOT performance as equivalently drafted teams. As an
> additional minor benefit, awarding the same points for ALLIANCE
> CAPTAINS and equivalent drafts lubricates the acceptance of draft
> offers between ALLIANCE CAPTAINS, which gives teams out of the top 8
> the chance to experience being ALLIANCE CAPTAINS themselves.
>
> **11.1.3Playoff Performance**
>
> This attribute measures team performance as part of an ALLIANCE.
>
> Teams that advance to at least MATCH 12 earn Double Elimination (DE)
> Points per the formula below, where β is defined in Table 11-4.

>
> The points earned for team awards in this system are not intended to
> capture the full value of the award to the team winning the award, or
> to represent the full value of the award to *FIRST*. In many ways, the
> team's experience in being selected for awards, especially the *FIRST*

> Star Award (which is optional for District Championship events), is
> beyond measure, and could not be fully captured in its entirety by any

> "*More than Robots®*," with the emphasis on our cultural awards, and
> to assist in elevating award-winning teams above non-award-winning
> teams in the ranking system.
>
> Teams only get points for team awards judged at the event. If an award
> is not judged (e.g. Rookie Highest Seed), is not for a team (e.g. the

> **11.1.5Team Age**
>
> This attribute recognizes the difficulty in being a rookie or

>
> Points are awarded to 2023 and 2024 rookie teams in recognition of the

> **11.3District Championships with Multiple Divisions**
>
> If a District Championship has too many teams to allow all teams 12
> Qualification MATCHES, then the event hosts multiple divisions. These
> events have 2 or 4 divisions (based on the number of teams
> participating, see Table 11-5) with approximately 40--60 teams in each
> division. Teams are assigned divisions by *FIRST* using a process
> developed by *FIRST* in Michigan.
>
> The process employs a "brute force iterative randomizer" and is
> executed as follows:
>
> **1.**The district team list is sorted in order of cumulative district
> points earned as described in [Section 11.1]{.underline} [District
> Events]{.underline}.

**2.**The list is divided into quartiles based on rank (e.g. the first
quartile has the top 25% ranked teams).

> **3.**Division assignments are randomly generated using equal
> contributions from each quartile.
>
> **4.**3 criteria are calculated for each division:\
> a.average strength: the arithmetic mean of the district point values
> of teams in a division b.distribution of strength: the Signal to Noise
> Ratio (SNR) of the district point values of teams in a division. SNR
> is calculated as follows:
>
> 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆= 10 log 𝑥𝑥̅2\
> 𝜎𝜎2

𝑥𝑥̅ = arithmetic mean of the district points in a division

σ = standard deviation of the district points in a division

> At the 2024 *FIRST* Championship presented by BAE Systems, teams are
> split into 8 divisions. The process used to assign teams to their
> division is as follows:
>
> **1.**Rookies are assigned randomly, team by team, sequentially to
> divisions (i.e. a team in Division 1, a team in Division 2, a team in
> Division 3, a team in Division 4, a team in Division 5, a team in
> Division 6, a team in Division 7, a team in Division 8, then back to
> Division 1 again, until Rookies are all assigned to a division).
>
> **2.**Step 1 is repeated with veteran teams.
>
> Each division plays a standard tournament as described in [Section
> 10.5 Qualification MATCHES]{.underline} and [Section10.6 Playoff
> MATCHES]{.underline} to produce the division Champions. Those 8
> division Champions proceed to the Championship Playoffs, on the
> Einstein FIELDS, to determine the 2024 *FIRST* Robotics Competition
> Championship Winners, per [Section 12.4 *FIRST* Championship
> Playoffs]{.underline}.
>
> **12.1Advancement to the *FIRST* Championship**
>
> Details on how teams earn eligibility to attend the *FIRST*
> Championship are posted on the
>
> **12.24-ROBOT ALLIANCES**
>
> There is no provision for BACKUP TEAMS at the *FIRST* Championship.
>
> Instead, before each division Playoff Tournament, ALLIANCES are
> selected per the process as described in [Section 10.6.1 ALLIANCE
> Selection Process]{.underline}, however the process continues with a
> third round of selection as follows.
>
> **Round 3:** The same method is used for each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN'S third
> choice except the selection order is reversed again, with ALLIANCE 1
> picking first and ALLIANCE 8 picking last. This process results in 8
> ALLIANCES of 4 teams each.
>
> ALLIANCES may start with any 3 of the 4 ROBOTS on their ALLIANCE
> during division Playoff MATCHES and during the Championship Playoffs.
> ALLIANCES submit LINEUPS for their MATCHES as described in
> [Section10.6.4 LINEUPS]{.underline}.
>
> **12.3*FIRST* Championship Pit Crews**
>
> *FIRST* distributes buttons to the ALLIANCE CAPTAINS during the
> ALLIANCE CAPTAIN meeting, which takes place on the division FIELDS.
> These buttons provide the necessary access to the ARENA for pit crew
> members.
>
> **C301\*Wear your buttons.** Only team members wearing proper buttons
> are allowed on the ARENA floor during division and Playoff MATCHES.
>
> *Violation: MATCH won't start until the situation is corrected. Those
> not displaying identification must leave the ARENA.*

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > Teams should assume they may be chosen for an ALLIANCE and think    |
| > about the logistics of button distribution and set a plan prior to  |
| > the ALLIANCE selection process. It is each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN'S       |

>
> A team pit is the designated space, usually 10 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft.
> (\~3 m x 3 m x 3 m), where a team may work on their ROBOT. Each team
> is assigned a pit space marked with their team number. This helps team
> members, judges, and visitors find teams easily. Each team pit has a
> table and power outlet.
>
> Teams, volunteers, *FIRST* staff, and guests spend a lot of time in
> the pits. Get to know other teams and help each other when you can.
> Time is short and help is very often right \"next door\" in the
> adjacent team pits.
>
> Small, bench-top machinery, with appropriate guards, is permitted in
> team pits. 'Small' machinery is machinery that can be easily lifted by
> one person and examples include, but are not limited to, small band
> saws, drill presses, desktop CNC mills, and sanders.
